# NOTICE

This repository is a code dump containing the code from a live demo at [Solid
Amsterdam](https://www.meetup.com/Solid-Netherlands/events/263745707/). It was intended to give a
high-level overview of different approaches to Solid development with live commentary, and thus is
not necessarily up-to-date, bug-free, or adhering to best practices.

# Exploration of client-side RDF libraries

An exploration of how to perform common operations using three Solid libraries.

To try them out, you need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org).

Get the code by opening a terminal and running:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:inrupt/solid-lib-comparison.git;
cd solid-lib-comparison;
npm install;
```

Then run either of the following commands to view the code for that library, and run `npm start` to
start the application. The relevant code can be found in [`src/services`'](./src/services/).

# ldflex

    git checkout ldflex

# rdflib

    git checkout rdflib

# Tripledoc

    git checkout tripledoc
